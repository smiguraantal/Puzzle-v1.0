# Puzzle v1.0

A classic Image Puzzle game that I developed in 2004 using the Swing framework.

## Requirements and Setup

Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8

Note: The program is optimized for JRE 1.8 and may not run correctly on newer versions.

To start the application, run the `Puzzle.java` file located in the `org.example` package.

## Source code

The source code is currently under review and will be uploaded at a later time.
