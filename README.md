# Puzzle v1.0

## Overview

A classic Image Puzzle game that I developed in 2004 using the Swing framework.

## Requirements and Setup

Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.8

Note: The program is optimized for JRE 1.8 and may not run correctly on newer versions.

To start the application, run the `Puzzle.java` file located in the `org.example` package.

## The purpose of the game

The goal of the Puzzle game is to complete a randomly divided image by swapping the pieces.

## Game rules

- To swap pieces, click on two different image tiles one after the other.
- To cancel a selection, click again on the selected tile.
- If you can't find the correct piece for a specific spot, right-click on the tile in that spot, and the original piece will jump back to its place.
- If you are struggling to complete the image and would like to see the full picture, select the "Solve" option from the menu.
- The selection and grid color can be changed using the color palette.
- Once an image is completed, its tiles can no longer be swapped. If you wish to try again, select the "Shuffle" option from the menu.
- To solve a different image, you can choose from seven additional images.
- If the difficulty is too easy or too hard, you can adjust it by clicking on the squares with plus or minus symbols.

## Settings

__Selection__

It can be set whether the selected tile should be marked with a dashed line, and the selection can also be cleared.

__Grid__

This menu option allows you to hide or show the grid that separates the tiles.

__Thumbnail__

A reduced version of the original image to be completed can be placed in the bottom right corner of the screen, which greatly aids in solving the puzzle.

__Color Palette__

This option brings up the palette used to set the colors of the selection and the grid.

__Resolution__

You can choose whether the squares with plus and minus symbols, responsible for slicing the image, should be visible.

__Labels__

The letters and numbers of the grid points can be displayed above and beside the image.

__Status Bar__

This menu option controls the visibility of the information box located at the bottom of the screen.

__Themes:__

The game interface can be changed to three different "themes," each providing a different appearance. The available themes are:

- Windows
- Metal
- CDE/Motif

## Source code

The source code is currently under review and will be uploaded at a later time.
